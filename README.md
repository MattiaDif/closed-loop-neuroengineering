# A reference architecture for closed-loop systems in the neurotechnology field

The goal of this project is to provide a rapid-prototyping, model-based design architecture to speed up the implementation of closed-loop systems for neuroengineering application on FPGAs. This is reached by means of the following process:

1.	Build a reference Simulink model to process neural data;
2.	Take advantage of the Fixed-Point Designer and HDL coder to implement the model on FPGA;
3.	Implementation and test on commercially available systems such as the Inatn RHS Stim/Recording System.

Retracing these steps, the user will be driven through the development process of a closed-loop system starting from the model design until the hardware immplementation.
