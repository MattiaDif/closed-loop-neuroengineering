# A reference architecture for closed-loop systems in the neurotechnology field

This project comes from a collaboration between the Rehab Technologies Lab at the Italian Institute of Technologies (Genoa) and the MathWorks® company.

The goal is to provide a rapid-prototyping, model-based design architecture to speed up the implementation of closed-loop systems for neuroengineering application on FPGAs. This has been reached by means of the following process:

1. Build a reference Simulink model to process neural data;
2. Take advantage of the Fixed-Point Designer and HDL code generator provided by MathWorks to implement the model on FPGA;
3. Implementation and test on commercially available systems such as the Inatn RHS Stim/Recording System ([Intan website](https://intantech.com/RHS_system.html)).

## GETTING STARTED TUTORIAL

An explanation about how to use the repo is provided at this link: [tutorial](https://mattia-di-florio.gitbook.io/closed-loop-neuroengineering/getting-started-tutorial).

## BACKGROUND

Backstage of the project: brief introduction of the main concepts and how the main goals have been achieved. 

### Custom Architecture

The Custom Architecture (CA) consists in an original Intan RHS Stim/Recording System Verilog code modification in order to hold the Verilog code generated by the Simulink model. Starting from the experience on the Simulink environment, the concept is to focus on it for the enhancement of the Intan system, in particular, taking advantage of the MathWorks HDL Coder™ which allows to convert a Simulink model in a language that can be synthetized for the FPGA.

Further details at: [here](https://mattia-di-florio.gitbook.io/closed-loop-neuroengineering/background/4.-custom-architecture).

### Custom Architecture on FPGA

After the modelling of the custom architecture, the next step has been its implementation on FPGA. In this step, the MathWorks HDL Coder™ is required to generate the Verilog code to be integrated into the original Verilog architecture.

Further details at: [here](https://mattia-di-florio.gitbook.io/closed-loop-neuroengineering/background/5.-custom-architecture-on-fpga).

### GUI Customization

To provide custom communication between the Host PC and the FPGA a personalization of the original Intan GUI has been developed. The two main modification at the C++/Qt code regards the possibility to enable or not the CA from the user interface, and adding an option to load custom parameters for the spike detection.

Further details at: [here](https://mattia-di-florio.gitbook.io/closed-loop-neuroengineering/background/6.-gui-customization).

### Simulink Library

A custom Simulink library with ready-to-use blocks has been developed. Thus, the user can design his own algorithms for the Intan RHS system just connecting the already tested and preconfigured Simulink blocks.
