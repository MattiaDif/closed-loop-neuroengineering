# A reference architecture for closed-loop systems in the neurotechnology field

The goal of this project is to provide a rapid-prototyping, model-based design architecture to speed up the implementation of closed-loop systems on FPGAs. This is reached by means of the following specific objectives:
1.	Build a reference Simulink model to process neural data. 
2.	Take advantage of the Fixed-Point Designer and HDL coder to implement the model on FPGA;
3.	Establish use cases on commercially available systems. We will implement and test on an Intan Stimulation/Recording system and we will investigate and report on feasibility for Neuropixels probe systems.
