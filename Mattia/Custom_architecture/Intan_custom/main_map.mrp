  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Design Summary

Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   9

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:2310 - Too many comps of type "DSP48A1" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal LVDS_1_p connected to top level port LVDS_1_p has
   been removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal LVDS_1_n connected to top level port LVDS_1_n has
   been removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal LVDS_2_p connected to top level port LVDS_2_p has
   been removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal LVDS_2_n connected to top level port LVDS_2_n has
   been removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal LVDS_3_p connected to top level port LVDS_3_p has
   been removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal LVDS_3_n connected to top level port LVDS_3_n has
   been removed.
WARNING:Timing:3159 - The DCM, variable_freq_clk_generator_inst/DCM_CLKGEN_1, has the attribute DFS_OSCILLATOR_MODE not set to
   PHASE_FREQ_LOCK. No phase relationship exists between the input clock and CLKFX or CLKFX180 outputs of this DCM. Data paths between these
   clock domains must be constrained using FROM/TO constraints.
WARNING:Timing:3175 - hi_in<0> does not clock data to hi_out<1>
WARNING:Timing:3225 - Timing constraint COMP "hi_out<1>" OFFSET = OUT 11.93 ns AFTER COMP "hi_in<0>" "RISING" ignored during timing analysis

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network ok1<30> has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 793 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   ok1<29>,
   N2695,
   N2699,
   MISO1_B_IBUF,
   MISO2_B_IBUF
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 916 block(s) removed
1067 block(s) optimized away
 939 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).
