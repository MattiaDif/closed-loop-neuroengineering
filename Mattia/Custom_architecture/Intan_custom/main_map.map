Updating timing models...
WARNING:Timing:3159 - The DCM, variable_freq_clk_generator_inst/DCM_CLKGEN_1, has the attribute DFS_OSCILLATOR_MODE not set to
   PHASE_FREQ_LOCK. No phase relationship exists between the input clock and CLKFX or CLKFX180 outputs of this DCM. Data paths between these
   clock domains must be constrained using FROM/TO constraints.
WARNING:Timing:3175 - hi_in<0> does not clock data to hi_out<1>
WARNING:Timing:3225 - Timing constraint COMP "hi_out<1>" OFFSET = OUT 11.93 ns AFTER COMP "hi_in<0>" "RISING" ignored during timing analysis
ERROR:Pack:2310 - Too many comps of type "DSP48A1" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
