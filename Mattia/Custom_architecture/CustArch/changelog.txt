cust_arch_18 --> old version from intan_cust_arch repo, first filter

cust_arch_19 --> old version from intan_cust_arch repo, rough spike detection (simulink ok, fpga ok)

CustArch --> version from cust_arch_22 of intan_cust_arch repo

CustArch_v2 --> processing subsystem erased, AC data put in DC slot (simulink ok, fpga ok)

CustArch_v3 --> processing subsystem with the first version of bandpass filter, AC filtered data into DC (WRONG --> filtering approach does not take into account the previous sample)

CustArch_v3 --> processing subsystem only with highpass filter, AC filtered data into DC (WRONG --> filtering approach does not take into account the previous sample)

CustArch_v4 --> processing subsystem only with second version of highpass filter, AC filtered data into DC (WRONG --> filtering approach does not take into account the previous sample)

CustArch_v5 --> processing subsystem (mch) with 1st order IIR highpass (simulink ok, fpga timing issue)

CustArch_v6 --> processing subsystem (mch) with 2nd order IIR highpass (WRONG --> lose previous sample once used for filtering)

CustArch_v7 --> processing subsystem (mch) with 2nd order IIR highpass (simulink ok, fpga timing issue)

CustArch_v8 --> processing subsystem (mch) with 2nd order IIR highpass with new fixed-point conversion according to real in-vivo recording (Mondino project Marta) + deleting of one input RAM (for processing RAM) (simulink ok, fpga timing issue)

CustArch_v9 --> filtering method according to cust_arch_18, filter 1st order IIR + change output logic input processing RAM (simulink ok, fpga ok)

CustArch_v10 --> filtering method according to cust_arch_18, 2nd order IIR highpass (simulink ok, fpga no)

CustArch_v10 --> as CustArch_v9 but with other filter parameters (simulink ok, fpga no --> need to check)
