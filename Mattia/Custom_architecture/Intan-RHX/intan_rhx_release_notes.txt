- Added ability to display thresholded analog inputs as digital signals in Spectrogram Tool.
- In data file playback mode, added 'run immediately' option after 'jump to position'.
- Extended range of y-axis spacing between waveforms on waveform display.
- Fixed bug where 'Stop' button was not working during rewinding.
- Fixed bug where the 'Automatically Save Trigger Channel' option in triggered recording was not working.
- Fixed issue where software crashed upon exiting on some Macs.
- Fixed crashing upon software startup with some smaller screens.

   - Added ability to disable and enable individual channels for TCP output while system is running.
   - Improved TCP parser so that path names and file names may include spaces.
   - Fixed TCP output timestamps to match timestamps in recorded data.
   - Fixed issue where TCP data output could fill up software 'Waveform FIFO' buffer under certain conditions.
   - Changed TCP parameter name 'DisplayTriggerAnalogVoltageThresholdVolts' to 'TriggerAnalogVoltageThresholdVolts'.
- Switched to latest version (v5.2.3) of Opal Kelly DLL.
- Changes to support Linux compilation.
- Windows installer:
   - Fixed issue where certain anti-virus programs would interfere with Windows installation.
   - Added additonal DLLs to Windows installation:

- In "One File Per Signal Type" data file format, added option to save auxiliary inputs (e.g., acccelerometer data) in amplifier.dat file.
- Fixed bug that sometimes causes crashing when PC audio was enabled.
- Fixed bug that did not display auxiliary inputs or supply voltages from second headstage when dual headstage adapter was used.
- Expanded OpenCL compatibility to fix problems with OpenCL initialization on some systems.
